Planty Pot

HOW TO PLAY
Plant seeds and water them to grow! Sell grown plants for money to buy more seeds! You can close the game and the plants will continue growing.

ARRAYS
An array of Pot objects is created in MyWorld.
An array of PlantData objects (data for each plant to be saved across files) is created in PlayerData.

CHEATS
Press/hold 'A' to pass time faster (plants will grow thirsty and grow faster).
